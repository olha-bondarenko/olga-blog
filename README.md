# Olga's Blog

This project was created as a personal blog of Olga Bondarenko to demonstrate her coding skills and to introduce her to the potential employer. The app was created using Angular v13 and Node.js v16. For the styling Ng-zorro library was used and projecy is mobile responsive. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` in the frontend directory to run client side and `npm start` in the backend directory to start a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` for cleind part and `http://localhost:5000/` for server. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The live version of the app can be found <a href="https://b-olga.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Build

Run `npm run prebuild` in the root folder to prepare the build and `npm run build` after. The build artifacts will be stored in the `built/` directory and client side in `built/public`.

## Running unit tests

Unit tests will be added in the nearest future.

## Further steps

- improve User Experience 
- improve navigation within the app (add breadcrumbs for the single blogpost to navigate back to the list of posts)
- test for different browsers compatibility
- make a research for more creative styling
